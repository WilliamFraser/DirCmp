About
-----
DirCmp is a python program that allows the user to compare the contents of 2
directories (and all subdirectories and files) in a visual way.  I origionally
wrote it to check that copying of large amounts of files had occured correctly.
However it is also useful for comparing 2 versions of directories (e.g. if a
copy was placed in different places, and you're not sure which version you want
to keep).  It also has features to compare individual files that differ, in
part to see which version you want, but if you use something like meld (which I
do), it will allow you to compare and edit the specified files, and will update
the comparison after exiting that application, allowing the user to view, pick,
chose, and edit differing files.  There is also the facility to clone or delete
differing files and directories, again to allow the user to edit the
directories being compared.

Be Aware
--------
Just to reiterate, this program is provided as is without any warranty.  I'm
not a profesional software developer.  I have tested it but not under every
possible circumstance, or in every possible situation, and there may well be
bugs that I've not spotted.  The comparison part of the program should in
theory offer no risks (assuming there are no missed bugs), but the copy and
delete options obviously change data on your drives.  There is no undo option:
once it's done, it's likely irreversible, so be careful.  I also can't vouch
for the third party comparison utilities that DirCmp links to (or the
underlying python or PyQt libraries for that matter).  As such there is no
warranty, and you use it entirely at your own risk, and by using this software,
you agree to this.  Neither myself, nor any other contributers are in anyway
liable for any consequence of you using it.

That said, I do try and make it as reliable as possible, and if you spot any
problems, bugs, or flaws, please email me at william.fraser@virgin.net with
full details, and if possible I will try and fix them (depending on the
circumstances, and my decision is final).  Alternatively feel free to submit
bug corrections directly to the github site where this project is hosted.

Instalation
-----------
The DirCmp.py program can be saved to any directory that is convinient to you.

DirCmp.py is designed to run under python 3.  This will probably already be
present on most Linux distros.  The only other requirement is PyQt5.  If not
present, you can either install it from your package manager (the package is
called python3-pyqt5, so for Debian & Ubuntu based distros the command would
be "sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5" - without the quotes), or if you have
pip installed, and would rather use python's own package manager, then the
command is "pip3 install PyQt5-stubs" (again without the quotes).

Running
-------
You can either run it from the command line or make a link to run it from the
desktop.  If the file permissions are correct (if not use "chmod 755 DirCmp.py"
without quotes to make it executable) then simply type in either the full path
(i.e. "/home/william/DirCmp/DirCmp.py" without quotes), or if you are in the
same directory, then "./DirCmp.py" again without quotes.  This relies on
python3 being installed in the same place as on my machine (/usr/bin/python3)
 - a fairly safe assumption.  If not you can edit the first line of the program
with any text editor to change it to where your python3 executable is.  The
other way is to type "python3 DirCmp.py" (without the quotes and substituting
DirCmp.py for the full path name if running it from a directory other than
where the program is saved).

The alternative is making a menu or desktop short-cut.  How to do this this
varies from distro to distro.  Try right clicking the menu button or right
clicking on the open menu and see if there is an "Edit menu" or "Edit
applications" option.  This should open up an application to edit your menu
items.  Alternatively there may be a program in the system or settings menu
that allows you to edit your menu.  If not, all I can suggest is to use a
search engine to find out how to add an item to the start menu for your
distro.  When you have the menu editor open, and have created a new menu item,
you can set things generally to what you want, the important entry is the
command to run.  This should be "/usr/bin/python3 /home/william/DirCmp/DirCmp.py"
(again without quotes, and adjusted if needed to where your python executable
is located if needed, and where you have saved this program).

Adding a desktop shortcut again varies, but generally you right click on the
desktop, and select the "create new launcher" or "create new shortcut" option.
Once you have the editor open, the same general advice applies as to editing
a menu entry.
